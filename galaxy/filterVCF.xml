  <help>
This tool filters a VCF file based on locations of variants. It removes
variants that fall outside of the target regions.

It is designed to analyze a VCF file of the format produced by freebayes.
Because that program can call MNPs ("haplotypes"), this tool checks each
variant position of an allele; if any is within a target region, the variant
is kept. Also, freebayes sometimes calls multiple MNPs at one position;
currently, this tool keeps all the alleles at a position if at least one has
a variant within a target region.
