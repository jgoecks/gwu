  <help>
This tool produces re-alignment information for length-variant reads. For each
group of length variants, it aligns the reads to the expected target sequence.
It determines a consensus CIGAR for the group based on minimizing the edit
distance (number of substitutions) for the reads in that group. Preference is
given to external in/dels (see below), and then to in/dels closer to the 5'
end of reads.

The primary output file lists each read and all of the information necessary
to produce a SAM record based on the new alignment. The optional verbose log
output file gives additional information about the potential CIGARs considered
for each set of reads. Note that no judgment is made by this tool about the
quality of the reported alignments.

**External in/dels**

Insertions or deletions that appear at the 5' or 3' end of a read are called
*external*. Alignments with external in/dels are given preference over other
alignments for two reasons:

1. External in/dels may be an artifact of a PCR primer mispriming on a similar
sequence near the expected location. For this reason, external in/dels are
evaluated for such a primer match, and the score (on a 0-1 scale -- see
*Primer matching score* below) is reported in the output file(s) (the final
judgment about whether or not an external in/del is an artifact is not made
by this tool). The reference genome is required to examine external
insertions because the putative mispriming site falls outside of the given
primer/target sequences.

2. External in/dels are unlikely to lead to variant calls by a conventional
approach. With an external deletion, the gap would not be apparent to a read
mapper. An external insertion may be a matching repeat, or it may be mapped
incorrectly with a series of SNPs. By reporting such alignments as external,
this tool ensures that the tool *Edit a SAM file* will give preference to
them over equivalent mappings.

-----

**Primer matching score**

To evaluate whether a primer is likely to bind to a given DNA segment, the
following weighted scoring function was developed. The last 20 bases of the
primer are numbered 1-20, with #20 at the 3' end. Each base is valued
according to its position::

  Position   Value
    1-10     2*pos
   11-19     3*pos
     20      5*pos
   other       1

The values of the matches between the primer and the DNA segment are summed
and divided by the sum of the values of all positions. This gives the
score, on a scale of 0-1, with 1 representing a perfect match.

Primers shorter than 20bp are numbered to leave off the lower positions
(e.g. an 18bp primer is numbered 3-20). Primers longer than 20bp have all
positions upstream of the last 20bp valued at 1.

For example::

  primer  ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG
  genome  TGGTACTTAGGGACGCACGTGCG
            **** ** * *** **** **

The score of this primer match is 483 / 618 = 0.782.

-----

**Primer and target file**

This input file should list, on each line, an amplicon name, followed by the
sequences of the forward primer, the reverse primer, and the target region,
comma-delimited. All sequences should be given with respect to the plus
strand.

The file produced by the tool *Retrieve primers and target sequences* follows
this format.
