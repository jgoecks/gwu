  <help>
This tool checks for length-variant reads. To be reported, a group of reads
with length significantly different from expected must constitute at least
the specified minimum fraction of the total number of reads from that
amplicon.

The output file lists the variants found for each amplicon. If one is not
interested in specific variants, the corresponding lines may be deleted from
this file prior to read retrieval by the tool *Get length-variant reads*.
